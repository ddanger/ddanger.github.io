# ddanger.github.io

Static personal website for `ddanger.github.io`.

## The Important Rule

Edit the source files, then commit the generated HTML too.

GitHub Pages serves this repository as static files from the repo root. That means these generated files must stay committed:

- `index.html`
- `about/index.html`
- `services/index.html`
- `contact/index.html`

Do not edit those generated HTML files by hand for normal page changes. Edit `src/`, run the build, and commit the generated output that changes.

CI verifies that the committed HTML matches the source. A post-merge workflow can sync generated HTML on `main`, but pull requests should still include generated HTML changes.

## Daily Workflow

1. Run `npm install` if dependencies are not installed.
2. Run `npm run dev`.
3. Edit source files under `src/`, or directly served files like `styles.css` and `script.js`.
4. Before committing, run `npm run build`.
5. Commit both your source changes and any generated HTML changes.

## Source vs Generated Files

Use these files for normal edits:

- `src/site.json` - shared site configuration
- `src/pages/*/meta.json` - page metadata and output paths
- `src/pages/*/content.html` - page body content
- `src/partials/*.html` - shared layout, header, and footer
- `src/client/` - source JavaScript modules
- `styles.css` - global styles served directly
- `script.js` - root client script served directly

These files are generated from `src/` and should be committed after running the build:

- `index.html`
- `about/index.html`
- `services/index.html`
- `contact/index.html`

## Commands

Start local development:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:8000`. The dev server builds once, serves the repo root, and rebuilds generated pages when `src/` changes.

Build generated HTML and format files:

```sh
npm run build
```

Run the checks CI cares about:

```sh
npm run validate:source
npm run verify:generated
npm run format:check
```

Use a different dev-server port when needed:

```sh
PORT=8010 npm run dev
```

## Requirements

- Node.js 24 or newer
- npm
- Git

Fresh clone setup:

```sh
npm run setup:init
```

For the full automation runbook, see `docs/automation.md`.

## Less Common Tasks

Regenerate the sitemap:

```sh
npm run generate:sitemap
```

Run the uptime check locally:

```sh
npm run check:uptime
```

After replacing `Resume-David-Dangerfield.pdf`, run the single resume update command to regenerate the social-share image, bump the cache-busting version, and rebuild the HTML:

```sh
npm run update:resume
```

Optional custom version:

```sh
npm run update:resume -- --version 20260901
```
